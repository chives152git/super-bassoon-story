There once was a man named jeff. Jeff enjoyed programming, he often coded in 
his free time. One day jeff was working away at a project he had started recently.
Little did he know that his work that day would destroy not only his life, but millions. 

Jeff decided to make a brand new for loop. He was well aware of the implications
of for loops, but he decided to do something that no one else has done
before. It is often told only in legend. He started the for loop at
i=1.
